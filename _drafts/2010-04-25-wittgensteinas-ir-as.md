Wittgenstein, without suffering the weight of humility, thought that his book Tractatus had solved all the problems there were and could ever be regarding philosophy and he left for Austria to train as a primary school teacher, indicating that that was the natural and rational next step after writing a book on philosophy. After abandoning his work as a school teacher, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener’s assistant in a monastery near Vienna, after being convinced that it would be more fulfilling to be a gardener’s assistant rather than a gardener. Nu ką, Wittgensteiną galima apibūdinti tik kaip subinę.
