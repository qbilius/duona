Straipsnis, kuriame Biyu He ir Marcus Raichle iškelia hipotezę, kaip randasi sąmonė smegenyse, baigiamas tokia padėka:

> *B.J.H. would also like to thank the U.S. Immigration Service under the Bush administration, whose visa background security check forced her to spend two months (following an international conference) in a third country, free of routine obligations—it was during this time that the hypothesis presented herein was initially conjectured.*
