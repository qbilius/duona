Labai įdomus pasiūlymas, kuris pamažu ir taip natūraliai įgyvendinamas – studijų laikotarpis vis ilgėja (vadinasi, išlaiko tave kiti), o pensinis amžius irgi ilgėja:

> *I once proposed a solution somewhat tongue in cheek to the problem of pensions: turn retirement upside down. In my plan, people would be supported by society up to the age of 30. During that period they would study, travel, prepare for a profession, reproduce and give full-time care to their young. They would not hold any positions of responsibility, where their youthful enthusiasm, unbounded energy and over-ambition were likely to cause problems. After 30, they would work until they dropped dead or became incapacitated.*
