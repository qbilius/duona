Malcolm Gladwell apžvelgia Chris Anderson knygą apie nemokamą skaitmeninę ateitį. Tik dar labiau įsitikinu, kad visą kūrybą reikia platinti nemokamai, o pinigai ateis kitais keliais. Įdomiausi teiginiai:

**Apie piratavimą:**

> *****To musicians who believe that their music is being pirated, Anderson is blunt. They should stop complaining, and capitalize on the added exposure that piracy provides by making money through touring, merchandise sales, and “yes, the sale of some of [their] music to people who still want CDs or prefer to buy their music online.*

****Labai įdomus požiūris į žiniasklaidą:**

> *****Newspapers need to accept that content is never again going to be worth what they want it to be worth, and reinvent their business. “Out of the bloodbath will come a new role for professional journalists,” he predicts, and he goes on:*
>
> **“There may be more of them, not fewer, as the ability to participate in journalism extends beyond the credentialed halls of traditional media. But they may be paid far less, and for many it won’t be a full time job at all. Journalism as a profession will share the stage with journalism as an avocation. Meanwhile, others may use their skills to teach and organize amateurs to do a better job covering their own communities, becoming more editor/coach than writer. If so, leveraging the Free—paying people to get other people to write for non-monetary rewards—may not be the enemy of professional journalists. Instead, it may be their salvation.”

**Kodėl?**

> *There are four strands of argument here: a technological claim (digital infrastructure is effectively Free), a psychological claim (consumers love Free), a procedural claim (Free means never having to make a judgment), and a commercial claim (the market created by the technological Free and the psychological Free can make you a lot of money).*

(Tačiau geriau paskaityti visą straipsnį ir susipažinti su argumentais.)

****Iš šių teiginių man labiausiai įstrigo antrasis:**

> *****“From the consumer’s perspective, there is a huge difference between cheap and free,” Anderson writes. “Give a product away, and it can go viral. Charge a single cent for it and you’re in an entirely different business. . . . The truth is that zero is one market and any other price is another.”*
